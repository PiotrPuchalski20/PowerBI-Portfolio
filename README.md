# Power BI Portfolio

Welcome to my Power BI project portfolio! This repository showcases several dashboards and reports built with Power BI to demonstrate my skills in data visualization, data modeling, and business intelligence. Most of the datasets were sourced from a course I completed on Udemy.com.

## ðŸ“Š Projects

- [Market Mindz Sales Report](./Market%20Mindz/) - my first project, focused primarily on the fundamental principles of good report design and composition.
- [Kraken Koffee Infographic](./Kraken%20Koffee/) - a more creative report that combines background design elements with more advanced DAX formulas, demonstrating best practices in formatting and visualization.
- [Austin Housing App](./Austin%20Housing) - a fully functional real estate research app built with actual housing data from Austin, Texas. This project emphasizes interactivity, including parameters, bookmarks, and other features to ensure a user-friendly experience.

Feel free to explore each project folder to see the datasets, PBIX files, design elements and a **detailed description**.
